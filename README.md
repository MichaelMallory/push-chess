# Push Chess

A modern web implementation of Push Chess, a fascinating chess variant where pieces can push their friendly pieces along their path of movement. Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## What is Push Chess?

Push Chess follows all standard chess rules with one major addition: pieces can push their friendly pieces along their path of movement. This creates entirely new tactical possibilities and strategies not seen in regular chess.

### Key Features:
- All standard chess rules apply (piece movements, captures, check, checkmate)
- Any piece can push any number of friendly pieces along its path of movement
- Pushed pieces move as a "train" and must remain contiguous
- Pieces can be pushed to squares they normally couldn't move to themselves
- Pawns promote when reaching the opposite rank (through regular moves, captures, or being pushed)

For detailed rules, see [RULES.md](RULES.md).

## Features

- üéÆ Play against AI or another human player
- üéØ Visual indicators for valid moves and pushes
- ‚ö° Real-time move validation

- üëë Pawn promotion with piece selection
- ‚öîÔ∏è Check and checkmate detection
- üé® Beautiful, responsive UI with smooth animations
- üéµ Visual and interactive feedback for moves
