# Push Chess Rules

Push Chess is a chess variant that follows all standard chess rules with the addition of "pushing" mechanics that allow pieces to move multiple friendly pieces during their turn.

## Basic Rules
- All standard chess rules apply (piece movements, captures, check, checkmate)
- The goal remains the same: make it so no legal moves are available for the opponent's king
- Any piece can push any number of your own pieces along their path of movement
- Only your own pieces can be pushed (opponent's pieces cannot be pushed under any circumstances)

## Pushing Mechanics
1. When moving a piece, you can push any number of your own pieces that are in the path of movement (no maximum limit)
2. Pushed pieces move along the same line of movement as the pushing piece
3. Pushed pieces behave like a "train" - they must remain contiguous after being pushed
4. The pushing piece can capture an opponent's piece at its destination after completing all pushes
5. Pushed pieces cannot capture during the push
6. Pieces cannot be pushed beyond opponent's pieces
7. Pieces can be pushed to squares they normally couldn't move to themselves
8. The final position after a push cannot leave your own king in check, though pieces can be pushed through squares that would temporarily create check

## Special Cases
### Knight Pushing
- Knights physically traverse their L-shaped path, pushing pieces as they go
- Pieces encountered along the knight's path are pushed to the next square in that direction
- A single knight move can push pieces in multiple directions as it traverses its L-shaped path
- Pieces are pushed as if the knight physically moves through each square of its L-shaped path

### Pawn Behavior
- Pawns can push pieces when moving forward
- Pawns cannot push pieces during diagonal capture moves
- Pawns can be pushed backward by other pieces
- When a pawn is pushed to the promotion rank, it promotes immediately

### Check and Pushing
- A king in check can escape via:
  - Standard moves
  - Being pushed by friendly pieces
  - Moving and pushing other pieces to block or escape
- Pieces can be pushed to block a check
- For checkmate to occur, all possible combinations of moves and pushes must be exhausted
- All push combinations must be considered when determining if checkmate has occurred
